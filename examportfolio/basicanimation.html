            Creation of an animated character with a befitting background, to be drawn in Illustrator and brought to life via an animated sprite in CSS.
            <br />
            <br />
            The character was to be developed from hand-drawn sketches, with specific and distinct features for it to become unique and distinguishable.
            <br />
            <br />
            The animated character was to be created based on a source of inspiration for its drawing style, complete with sketches of a walk cycle/change of expression, to be then illustrated within a sprite sheet.
            <br />
            <br />
            To be done with a background story and character-specific traits. The animation process was to be drawn in Illustrator with added HTML+CSS code.

            <br />
            <br />
            Learned to manoeuvre the drawing application, Adobe Illustrator, whilst gaining knowlegde of using and applying different strokes and outlines, textures, shapes and other visual elements in the drawing process (both for the individual character and its background).
            <br />
            <br />
            Gained insight into the 12 principles of animation and UI, so that when applied, it could give my animated characters and objects the illusion of gravity, weight, mass and/or flexibility, among other things. Learned to apply a storyboard serving as a visual representation of still pictures, where each key moment of a film or sequence is drawn out and presented in order, similar to a picture book.
            <br />
            <br />
            Learned how to do character sketching. Then, drawing sprite sheets and using sprite animation to create movement/animation effects using HTML and CSS. Later, learned how coupled with a touch of JavaScript, CSS animations and transitions are fully controllable.

        <h2 class="omboarding">Onboarding for Potential Students</h2>

        <p class="taskomb">
            <span class="focus">MAIN TASK AND SOLUTION</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            To create an interactive, animated, web-based onboarding sequence that through gamification explains an important aspect about moving to Denmark to be a student at KEA, Multimedia Design.
            <br />
            <br />
            In this sequence, the target group was aimed - specifically - at non-Danes who are not living in Denmark and who are in the process of deciding whether they should apply to KEA's Multimedia Design course in Copenhagen.
            <br />
            <br />
            One main concern was to be formulated and chosen to illustrate the concerns of potential students. In this case: the alienating feeling one has when entering and having to navigate a new building.
            <br />
            <br />
            Game-like elements had to be included i.e. a reward system, levels, lives etc. alongside animations made with CSS that make use of animation principles.
            <br />
            <br />
            <span class="focus">TEAM ROLE </span>
            <br />
            <br />
            Concept, story and game developing, illustrating different elements, writing the game-specific copy and microcopy and drawing the level-specific in-game items, to name a few.
        </p>

        <p class="gainsomb">
            <span class="focus">SKILLS GAINED</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            Learned how to present a creative method for applying the gamification technique onto building and campus maps to improve the onboarding experience of new/potential students in any educational organization - but specifically tailored here for KEA.
            <br />
            <br />
            Learned the main principles behind creating animation using only code and self-made illustrations. Comprehended how an onboarding sequence can be defined as a set of activities and processes to solve problems by using or applying the characteristics of game elements.
            <br />
            <br />
            Through the development process, I learned how an onboarding game can prove to be a useful tool to gain insight into how a user experiences a service, process, or product. With the feedback and testing, I have learned how to make informed improvements to deliver a better experience for future users.
            <br />
            <br />
            Grasped the key roles and advantages - through the experience - of creating a large project in a group, where the work is divided and where each member of the given team is responsible for a different task.
