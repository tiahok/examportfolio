            <br />
            <br />
            To learn web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and/or screen sizes. The main task of the theme was to build a website that has a responsive layout, i.e a layout that responds to the user's behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.
            <br />
            <br />
            A websites core consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media content, and so on. When I was building my responsive site, I had to assemble these files into a sensible structure and make sure they can talk to one another. The motif of the overall design was continued from the color and visuals of the moodboard I had made for the "flat design principles" illustration. My main emphasis was put on finding a simple solution to the design problem and thus creating a visually effective website that is overall user-experience friendly and allows improved browsing experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since using mobiles and movile-centered layouts has become a popular trend within the UX design and development communities, I was mainly applying this mobile principle in creation of my site. The exploding of mobile phones, in general, urges designers to pay attention to this trend, therefore this was a key point in my learning curve.

            <span class="focus">SKILLS GAINED</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            Before I started writing the code for my website, I had to devise a plan. What information and content will I be showcasing? What fonts and colors should I be using in addition to the moodboards guide? What will my overall layout look like? Through this process, I have gained insight into the importance of outlining a simple method one can follow to plan out any site's content and design.
            <br />
            <br />
            Research, as the first step. Then planning the layout of the pages, navigation and other basic design specifications. Understanding, exploring and applying the Gestalt principles of design.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to the aforementioned, learning how to build a wireframe was also part of my learning experience. Next, building the skeleton structure for HTML, and all the basic elements one-by-one, adding the CSS elements and the specific media queries. I have also learned that I must continuously check my page and make corrections, when necessary.
            <br />
            <br />
            Finally, I have gained the skill of XD prototyping and user testing. Overall, understanding that principles are applied for many reasons that go way beyond the "well, it looks good."
